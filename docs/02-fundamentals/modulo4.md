**Location:** `01_Fundamentals_Examples/Modulo4/`

## Overview

Collection of exercises demonstrating iterative programming with loops.

## Main Program

**Exercises21to24.java** - Menu system with multiple exercises

## Exercises

### Exercise 21 - Maximum and Average
- Input multiple integers
- Calculate and display the largest number
- Calculate and display the average
- Do-while loop with user-controlled exit

### Exercise 22 - Bill Payment Manager
- Input number of bills to pay
- For each bill: collect description and amount
- Display complete bill list
- Calculate and show total amount due

### Exercise 23 - Even Numbers (For Loop)
- Display all even numbers below 1000
- Uses for loop with modulo operator

### Exercise 023 - Even Numbers (While Loop)
- Same as Exercise 23 using while loop
- Demonstrates different loop approaches

### Exercise 24 - Odd-Even Pairs
- Display pairs of consecutive odd-even numbers below 1000
- Format: 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, etc.
- Uses loop with increment by 2
