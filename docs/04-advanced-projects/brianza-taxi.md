**Location:** `02_Tickets_Transportation/BrianzaTaxi`

## Overview

Brianza Taxi is a simple taxi receipt generation system that calculates fares based on distance, service class level, and time of day. The application accepts user input for journey parameters, performs price calculations, and generates HTML receipts with formatted output. This project introduces template-based file generation and basic financial calculations.

## Key Features

- Calculate taxi fares based on distance (minutes traveled)
- Support multiple service levels with different pricing
- Time-based pricing adjustments (peak hours, off-peak hours)
- Template-based HTML receipt generation
- File I/O for saving receipts
- Console-based user interface for fare input
- Professional formatted receipt display

## Technologies Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (basic structure)
- Template pattern for HTML generation
- File I/O (FileWriter, Template loader)
- String manipulation and formatting
- Console input/output operations
- Basic arithmetic for price calculations

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn how to build a simple transactional system with calculation logic, implement template-based file generation, handle multiple input parameters, perform financial calculations, and create formatted output documents. The project demonstrates practical real-world application of basic programming concepts in a service-oriented context.
