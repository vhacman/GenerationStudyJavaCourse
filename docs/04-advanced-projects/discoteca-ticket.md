**Location:** `02_Tickets_Transportation/DiscotecaTicket`

## Overview

Discoteca Ticket is a nightclub entry ticket pricing system that calculates admission fees based on age and gender. The application implements access control policies, applies gender-based pricing, and provides immediate price feedback to visitors. This project demonstrates conditional logic and business rule implementation in a service context.

## Key Features

- Age verification for entry eligibility
- Gender-based ticket pricing
- Dynamic price calculation based on demographic factors
- Immediate feedback on pricing decision
- Access denial for underage visitors
- Gender-neutral and gender-specific pricing tiers
- Console-based ticket inquiry system

## Technologies Used

- Conditional logic (if/else statements)
- Ternary operator for compact decision making
- Character input for gender specification
- Integer input validation
- String message formatting
- Console I/O operations
- Basic business rule implementation

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn to implement business rules with conditional logic, apply different pricing based on demographic factors, handle character input for categorical data, implement access control policies, and provide immediate user feedback. The project demonstrates practical application of decision-making structures in real-world scenarios like venue management.
