**Location:** `04_Exercises_Practice/ExtraLesson2`

## Overview

Extra Lesson 2 is a cryptography implementation project focusing on the Caesar cipher algorithm. The application provides encryption and decryption functionality with a menu-driven interface, allowing users to encode and decode messages using shifted alphabet substitution. This project demonstrates practical application of string manipulation and character shifting algorithms.

## Key Features

- Caesar cipher encryption algorithm
- Caesar cipher decryption algorithm
- Interactive menu system with do-while loop
- User command processing (C for cipher, D for decipher, Q to quit)
- Character shifting with modular arithmetic
- Message processing character by character
- Clean command-based user interface
- Loop-based session management

## Technologies Used

- String manipulation and character processing
- Character shifting and modular arithmetic
- Switch statements for command routing
- Do-while loops for menu iteration
- Input validation and user feedback
- Algorithm implementation (Caesar cipher)
