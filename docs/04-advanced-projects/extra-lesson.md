# Extra Lesson

**Location:** `04_Exercises_Practice/ExtraLesson`

## Overview

Extra Lesson is a train ticket management system demonstrating object-oriented design with entity models and service-based processing. The application showcases ticket entity creation, automatic datetime assignment, validation logic, template-based receipt generation, and multi-ticket session management. It bridges simple procedural programs to professional service-oriented architectures.

## Key Features

- Ticket entity model with data encapsulation
- Automatic datetime assignment (LocalDateTime.now())
- Ticket validation logic within model
- Multi-ticket management in session
- Template-based HTML report generation
- File organization with ticket folders
- Service-oriented ticket processing
- Professional receipt output

## Technologies Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Entity models (Ticket class)
- LocalDateTime for automatic timestamps
- Template pattern for file generation
- File I/O operations
- String replacement for templates
- Validation methods in model classes
- Session management with loops

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn to create entity models that represent domain concepts, implement validation logic within models, use LocalDateTime for automatic values, apply the model-service pattern, manage multiple objects in collections, generate formatted output from models, and understand how to transition from procedural to object-oriented design. The project demonstrates practical OOP principles in real applications.
