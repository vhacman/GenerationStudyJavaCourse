# Milano Lecco Trains 2

**Location:** `02_Tickets_Transportation/MilanoLeccoTRains2`

## Overview

Milano Lecco Trains 2 is an enhanced train ticketing system for the Milano-Lecco regional rail line with four stations. The application manages ticket creation, validates station routing, calculates distances and fares, and supports multiple consecutive bookings. It demonstrates organized method extraction and input validation patterns with improved code structure.

## Key Features

- Four-station rail network (Milano, Monza, Osnago, Lecco)
- Automatic distance calculation between any station pair
- Dual-class pricing system with rate variations
- Comprehensive input validation with feedback loops
- Session management for multiple tickets
- Distance matrix implementation
- Private static method organization
- User-friendly error messages

## Technologies Used

- Method extraction for code organization
- Private static methods for encapsulation
- Do-while loops for validation
- Switch statements for station and distance handling
- Ternary operators for class-based pricing
- Case-insensitive string comparison
- Documentation with inline comments
- Modular code structure

## Learning Objectives

Students learn to organize code through method extraction, create reusable validation methods, implement distance lookup tables efficiently, apply encapsulation with private methods, manage multi-step user interactions, provide helpful error messages, and build extensible ticketing logic. The project emphasizes clean code practices and method design.
