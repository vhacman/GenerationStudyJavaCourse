**Location:** `02_Tickets_Transportation/MonzaMetro`

## Overview

Monza Metro is a metropolitan transit ticket system featuring service-based architecture with comprehensive ticket generation capabilities. The application manages ticket creation, pricing calculations, and formatted receipt output through organized service methods. The project demonstrates how service classes can encapsulate all business logic related to ticket management and presentation.

## Key Features

- Service-oriented ticket generation (TicketService)
- Comprehensive ticket model with validation
- Service methods for output formatting
- Template-based receipt generation
- Professional ticket presentation
- Method organization in service classes
- Multi-step ticket creation process
- Console-based user interface

## Technologies Used

- Service Layer pattern (TicketService)
- Object-Oriented design principles
- Template pattern for output generation
- Model classes for data representation
- Method extraction and organization
- File I/O and formatting
- Validation logic in service methods
- Date and time handling

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn to organize business logic in service classes, implement models that represent domain entities, create reusable service methods, apply the service layer pattern effectively, separate concerns between data models and business logic, manage ticket lifecycle through services, and develop professional service-based architectures. The project provides practical experience with common architectural patterns used in production systems.
