## Overview

Milano Lecco Trains 4 is a fully object-oriented train ticketing system with dedicated service classes and business logic separation. The application implements comprehensive railway operations including ticket generation, price calculation, journey validation, and receipt management. It showcases enterprise architecture patterns with clear model, service, and presentation layers.

## Key Features

- Object-oriented ticket management with Ticket entity
- Dedicated service classes (TicketService, ValidationService)
- Comprehensive ticket information tracking
- Multi-step journey validation process
- Dynamic HTML receipt generation
- Service method organization and delegation
- Data model with automatic calculations
- Professional error handling and validation

## Technologies Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Service Layer pattern for business logic
- Model-based design (Ticket entity)
- Separation of concerns across classes
- File I/O with structured approach
- Template pattern for HTML generation
- Method organization and delegation
- Data encapsulation principles

## Learning Objectives

Thi project helps to learn professional application architecture with dedicated service classes, implement model classes that encapsulate data and behavior, separate business logic from presentation, apply design patterns for scalability, delegate responsibilities to specialized services, organize complex logic into manageable components, and build systems that are easy to maintain and extend. The project demonstrates enterprise-quality code structure.
