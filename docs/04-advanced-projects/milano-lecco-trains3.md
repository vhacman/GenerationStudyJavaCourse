# Milano Lecco Trains 3

**Location:** `02_Tickets_Transportation/MilanoLeccoTrains3`

## Overview

Milano Lecco Trains 3 is an advanced train ticketing system utilizing modern Java features like switch expressions and pattern matching. The application provides enhanced rail ticket management with documentation, clear method responsibilities, and improved readability. It represents evolution from traditional switch statements to modern Java syntax patterns.

## Key Features

- Four-station network with modern Java implementation
- Switch expressions instead of traditional statements
- Pattern matching for station validation
- Comprehensive Javadoc documentation
- Clear separation of concerns through private methods
- Case-insensitive station handling
- Distance calculation with clean implementation
- Advanced Java language features

## Technologies Used

- Switch expressions (Java 13+)
- Pattern matching in switches
- Javadoc documentation format
- Enhanced string handling
- Modern Java syntax practices
- Private method organization
- Distance mapping algorithms
- Validation logic with expressions

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn modern Java language features, appreciate evolution of syntax, understand when to use switch expressions over statements, implement comprehensive documentation with Javadoc, organize code for clarity and maintainability, apply pattern matching concepts, and develop professional code practices. The project demonstrates current best practices in Java programming.
