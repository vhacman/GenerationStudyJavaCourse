# Brianza Trains

**Location:** `02_Tickets_Transportation/BrianzaTrains`

## Overview

Brianza Trains is a train ticket generation system for railway journeys with fixed route segments. The application manages ticket creation for passengers traveling on predetermined routes, calculates fares based on distance and class selection, and generates formatted receipts. The project demonstrates structured pricing logic and journey validation with ASCII-formatted output.

## Key Features

- Passenger information collection (name, surname, age)
- Class selection (1st or 2nd class) with different pricing
- Distance-based fare calculation
- Journey time tracking (departure and arrival times)
- Input validation for all fields
- Minimum fare threshold implementation
- ASCII-formatted receipt generation
- Support for multiple passengers

## Technologies Used

- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Control structures (if/else, conditional operators)
- Input validation and error handling
- Distance calculation based on class
- String formatting with escape sequences
- Console I/O operations
- Mathematical calculations for pricing
- Boolean logic for validation

## Learning Objectives


This project helps to  learn to implement validation logic for complex user input, perform conditional pricing calculations based on multiple factors, format professional output with special characters, manage passenger data systematically, and apply business rules (minimum fare) in pricing logic. The project provides practice in handling real-world transportation booking scenarios.
