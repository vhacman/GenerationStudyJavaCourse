# Taxes

**Location:** `04_Exercises_Practice/Taxes`

## Overview

Taxes is a business tax calculation system demonstrating financial logic with conditional discounts. The application calculates annual tax obligations based on business revenue, applies minimum revenue thresholds, and provides discount mechanisms for young companies. It showcases practical business logic implementation with percentage calculations and conditional rules.

## Key Features

- Annual revenue input and validation
- Tax exemption threshold (€20,000)
- Progressive tax calculation (20% above threshold)
- Young business discount eligibility (< 5 years)
- Discount application (20% reduction for young businesses)
- Final tax amount calculation
- User-friendly tax guidance messages
- Real-world business rules implementation

## Technologies Used

- Conditional logic and decision structures
- Percentage calculations (20% tax rate)
- Discount computation (20% reduction)
- Integer arithmetic for financial values
- String formatting for output
- Console I/O operations
- Multiple if/else conditions
- Business rule implementation

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn to implement business rule logic, perform percentage-based calculations, apply conditional discounts, handle financial data safely, implement progressive taxation systems, provide clear user feedback, and develop practical tax calculation systems. The project demonstrates how programming applies to real-world business scenarios and financial computation.
