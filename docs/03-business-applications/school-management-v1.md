**Location:** `03_Business_Applications/SchoolManagement_v1`

## Overview

School Management v1 is the foundational version of a school management system that models people within an educational institution. The application implements inheritance with Person, Student, and Teacher classes, demonstrating object-oriented principles through educational entities. It focuses on data model design and relationship management.

## Key Features

- Model Person entities with common attributes (name, surname, DOB)
- Extend Person with Student-specific properties (year, section)
- Extend Person with Teacher-specific properties
- Implement inheritance hierarchies for school personnel
- Calculate age from date of birth
- Demo classes showing entity usage
- String representation and toString() methods
- Test data generation and validation

## Technologies Used

- Inheritance and class hierarchies
- Object-oriented design (OOP)
- LocalDate for date handling
- Age calculation algorithms
- Entity modeling and design
- Demo/example class patterns
- toString() method implementation

## Learning Objectives

Students learn to design class hierarchies through inheritance, model real-world relationships with classes, implement parent-child class structures, leverage inheritance to avoid code duplication, and build extensible data models for educational systems.
