## Overview

Brianza Trains Objects is an object-oriented implementation of a train ticketing system. The application manages train tickets with distance-based pricing for different service classes, with comprehensive validation, testing, and HTML report generation. It demonstrates proper OOP design principles applied to transportation systems.

## Key Features

- Create train tickets with validated ticket IDs and distances
- Support two service class levels (first and second class)
- Calculate class-based pricing with distance multipliers
- Comprehensive input validation (distance > 0, valid classes)
- Unit testing of ticket pricing logic
- Detailed text-based ticket previews
- HTML export of confirmed tickets
- Test-driven development with JUnit tests

## Technologies Used

- Object-oriented design with Ticket entity
- Unit testing with JUnit framework
- Input validation patterns
- Template-based HTML rendering
- File I/O and documentation generation
- Test classes for behavior verification

## Learning Objectives

Students learn to design entities with proper validation, implement test-driven development, verify pricing calculations with unit tests, and build robust transportation ticketing systems with comprehensive quality assurance.
