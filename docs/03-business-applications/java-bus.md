- Validate ticket information before saving
- Generate text preview of ticket details
- Export tickets to HTML format
- Manage ticket ID and route information

## Technologies Used

- Object-oriented entity design (Ticket class)
- Pricing calculation algorithms
- Input validation with range checking
- Template-based rendering
- File I/O operations
- Console-based user interaction

## Learning Objectives
