## Overview

JavIta Airline is a ticket booking system for an airline that calculates ticket prices based on distance, service class, and membership discounts. The application captures flight information, applies dynamic pricing rules, and generates HTML confirmations. It showcases business logic implementation with enumerations for service classes and membership tiers.

## Key Features

- Create airline tickets with distance and service class selection
- Implement multiple service class tiers (BASIC, SILVER, GOLD)
- Apply membership-based discounts (NONE, SILVER, GOLD)
- Calculate dynamic pricing based on distance and class
- Validate ticket data before processing
- Generate HTML ticket confirmations
- Date and time handling for flight information

## Technologies Used

- Enumeration types (ServiceClass, MembershipType)
- Discount calculation algorithms
- LocalDate and LocalTime for scheduling
- File I/O and HTML template rendering
- Input validation and error handling
- Business logic encapsulation in model entities

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to learn to implement complex pricing logic using enumerations, manage discount calculations with multiple criteria, validate business requirements through entity methods, work with Java date/time APIs, and generate formatted documents from application data.
