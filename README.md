## How to Run
### Using an IDE

1. Import the project into your IDE
2. Navigate to the desired Java file
3. Right-click and select "Run As" → "Java Application"

## Example Programs

### NeedCalculator
Calculates nutritional coverage based on:
- Weight in kg
- Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats consumed (in grams)
- Outputs caloric and protein coverage percentages

Formula:
- Caloric need: 150 calories per kg of body weight
- Protein need: 1.5 grams per kg of body weight

### PrintHouseLabel
Calculates property pricing based on:
- Room dimensions
- Bathroom dimensions
- Balcony dimensions
- Square meter price
- Outputs total property price (balcony area counted at 50% value)
