Basic introductory programs:
- `HelloWorld.java` - Classic "Hello World" program
- `HelloMe.java` - Personalized greeting program

### Food (`com.generation.food`)
Nutrition-related calculators:
- `NeedCalculator.java` - Calculates daily caloric and protein needs based on weight and macronutrient intake
- `PrintFoodLabel.java` - Food labeling utilities
- `FoodAnalyzer.java` - Food analysis tools

### Geometry (`com.generation.geometry`)
Mathematical calculation programs:
- `SquareCalculator.java` - Square area and perimeter calculations
- `RectangleCalculator.java` - Rectangle area and perimeter calculations

### Housing (`com.generation.housing`)
Real estate calculation tools:
- `PrintHouseLabel.java` - Calculates and displays property information including area and price based on room dimensions

### Library (`com.generation.library`)

## How to Run
### Using an IDE

1. Import the project into your IDE
2. Navigate to the desired Java file
3. Right-click and select "Run As" → "Java Application"

## Example Programs

### NeedCalculator
Calculates nutritional coverage based on:
- Weight in kg
- Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats consumed (in grams)
- Outputs caloric and protein coverage percentages

Formula:
- Caloric need: 150 calories per kg of body weight
- Protein need: 1.5 grams per kg of body weight

### PrintHouseLabel
Calculates property pricing based on:
- Room dimensions
- Bathroom dimensions
- Balcony dimensions
- Square meter price
- Outputs total property price (balcony area counted at 50% value)
